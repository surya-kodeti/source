> A memoized wrapper around React.createContext. Used by [One App](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app) as a dependency to pass React context between [Holocron modules](https://github.com/americanexpress/holocron/tree/main/packages/holocron) without external usage.

## 🤹‍ Usage

### Installing

```bash
$ npm install --save create-shared-react-context
```

### Example

```js
import createSharedReactContext from 'create-shared-react-context';

const context = createSharedReactContext({}, 'someIdentifier');

```

## 🎛️ API
`createSharedReactContext` takes two arguments: `defaultValue` and `key`.

`defaultValue` is the same default value that would be used in `createContext`.

`key` is the identifier used to ensure that any subsequent call of `createSharedReactContext`
will return any previous created context with the same identifier.

### Motivation

In a modular application, sharing functionality between bundled modules with their own dependencies
can be done in a myriad of ways. If one wanted to be able to pass functionality using React 
Context, but each module has their own instance of the dependency creating that context, the
Provider used at the top would fail to pass context down to the Consumer, as the reference would
be different. You could declare that dependency as an external, so that the reference used by each
module would be shared, but sometimes a dependency may not require a separate instance to function.
